# Jack Davies CV
I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer and recent Founders & Coders Nazareth graduate. I love to write code that is readable, robust, elegant and scalable, and have a passion for pixel-perfect design that makes the user experience as intuitive and rewarding as possible.

I love to teach and learn from others, and am always keen to work with the latest technologies. I'm looking for a role where I can develop my skills and work with and learn from other like-minded people.

### EXPERIENCE

**16 Week Web Development Boot Camp, Nazareth (Feb - Jun 2017)**
- I participated in the very first Nazareth cohort of the hugely successful Founders & Coders web development boot camp.
- Halfway through I wrote a [medium article](https://medium.com/founders-coders/founders-and-coders-nazareth-life-as-an-international-student-c2be76fb161d) on the experience from the perspective of an international student.
- Along with the skills outlined above, I learned and applied **test driven development**, **agile methodologies** and **pair programming**.
- During the programme I was also involved in volunteering at weekly coding meetups and other coding-related projects in and around Nazareth.

**Mentoring (Jun - Oct 2017)**
- I stayed on in Nazareth to mentor the second cohort, which involved running workshops, helping out in class and facilitating the general administration of the course.
- During this time I also acted as QA on one of the recent graduate projects, [Nazareth Events](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-events)

**Disability Support Worker (2014-2017)**
- I worked as a note taker for the disability services department, which allowed me the opportunity to work with a wide variety of students in a supporting role.
- The experience also granted me a valuable insight into a multitude of different subjects and disciplines.
