# CV - Jack Davies
I am a full-stack JavaScript developer who loves to write code that is readable, robust, elegant and scalabale. I love good design that makes the user experience as intuitive and rewarding as possible.

I'm passionate about teaching and learning, and am always keen to work with the latest technologies. I'm looking for a role where I can develop my skills and work with and learn from other like-minded people.
